## Post-Deployment Testing Plan

### Test 1: First Pipeline Run ‚úÖ Ready
**Purpose**: Verify basic functionality

**Steps**:
1. Go to GitLab: CI/CD ‚Üí Pipelines ‚Üí Run Pipeline
2. Select:
   - Environment: cabgridmgr
   - Record Type: a_record
   - Operation: add
3. Paste sample CSV:
   ```csv
   name,ipv4addr,view,comment
   test1.example.com,192.168.1.10,default,Test record
   ```
4. Run pipeline

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Pipeline completes successfully
- [ ] pre_check runs and creates reports
- [ ] combined_report.html created (shows 1 run)
- [ ] execution_counters/pre_check_counter.json created
- [ ] Ansible deployment runs
- [ ] post_implementation runs and creates reports
- [ ] combined_report.html created (shows 1 run)
- [ ] execution_counters/post_check_counter.json created
- [ ] generate_execution_report runs
- [ ] execution_summary.html created
- [ ] Git commits include execution counts

### Test 2: Second Pipeline Run ‚úÖ Ready
**Purpose**: Verify history building

**Steps**:
1. Run pipeline again with same or different CSV
2. Check combined_report.html

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Pipeline completes successfully
- [ ] combined_report.html shows 2 runs
- [ ] Execution counts incremented
- [ ] Git commits show increased counts
- [ ] execution_summary.html updated

### Test 3: Report Verification ‚úÖ Ready
**Purpose**: Verify reports are accessible

**Steps**:
1. Go to pipeline artifacts
2. Navigate to robot_reports/
3. Check for all expected files

**Expected Files**:
- [ ] pre_check/report.html (current run)
- [ ] pre_check/combined_report.html (history) ‚≠ê
- [ ] pre_check/history/output_*.xml
- [ ] post_check/report.html (current run)
- [ ] post_check/combined_report.html (history) ‚≠ê
- [ ] post_check/history/output_*.xml
- [ ] execution_counters/pre_check_counter.json
- [ ] execution_counters/post_check_counter.json
- [ ] execution_summary.html

### Test 4: Operation Type ‚úÖ Ready
**Purpose**: Verify delete operation works

**Steps**:
1. Run pipeline with operation_type = "delete"
2. Check that it's passed to Ansible

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Pipeline completes successfully
- [ ] operation=delete passed to Ansible
- [ ] Commit message includes "delete"
- [ ] Reports created normally

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### If Issues Found

**Option 1: Use backup** (if created)
```bash
# If you saved the original
cp .gitlab-ci.yml.backup .gitlab-ci.yml
git add .gitlab-ci.yml
git commit -m "Rollback to original pipeline"
git push
```

**Option 2: Remove new features**
```bash
# Edit .gitlab-ci.yml
# Remove:
# - operation_type input
# - ExecutionCounter references
# - Reporting stage
# - Enhanced commit messages
```

**Note**: Unlikely to be needed - validation shows no issues!
